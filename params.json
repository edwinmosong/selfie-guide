This tutorial will be broken up in two parts: Windows and Ubuntu 13.10\r\n\r\n######NOTE: Tomorrow (April 17, 2014) the newest Ubuntu LTS version, 14.04, will be available to everyone. I suggest that if you plan on moving to the newer Ubuntu, to wait till after updating to do these steps.\r\n\r\n## Ubuntu 13.10\r\n\r\n#####Install Android Studio:\r\n[Click here](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/linux-studio)\r\nExtract the files to whenever you want your development area to be.\r\n\r\n#####Check if you have JAVA\r\nIn your terminal (CTRL+ALT+T shortcut):\r\n```\r\n$ java -version\r\nOpenJDK Runtime Environment (IcedTea 2.4.4) (7u51-2.4.4-0ubuntu0.13.10.1)\r\nOpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.45-b08, mixed mode)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see, I have included an example output of how it would look if you do have Java.\r\n\r\nIf you don't have Java, do the following in your terminal:\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get update\r\n$ sudo apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk\r\n```\r\nAnd press \"y\" if you are prompted. Let it do its thing.\r\n\r\n#####Install Git\r\nIn your terminal:\r\n```\r\n$ sudo apt-get update\r\n$ sudo apt-get install git\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt this point, you should be able to run Android Studio (if it doesn't, google your error or Facebook me) and can get started on Git cloning/pulling/etc. \r\n\r\n######Bonus: Netflix\r\n######Run these commands in the terminal:\r\n```\r\nsudo apt-add-repository ppa:ehoover/compholio\r\nsudo apt-get update\r\nsudo apt-get install netflix-desktop\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Windows\r\n\r\nSo for those of you who are running Windows...\r\n\r\n#####Install JDK\r\nInstall JDK 7 [Click me](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html)\r\n\r\n#####Install Git\r\nInstall Git [Click me](http://git-scm.com/download/win)\r\n\r\n#####Set your environment variable PATH\r\nThis is where most of you were having problems. Open \"My Computer\" (shortcut: Windows key + E) and right click on your computer, then click on properties.\r\n\r\nClick on \"Advanced System Settings\" and then click on Environment Variables (at the bottom of the new window). You will now see TWO lists (top and bottom), go to the bottom list and look for \"PATH\". Click on it and click \"edit\". \r\n\r\nNow, you will have to do these steps for both Git and the JDK. \r\n\r\nGo to the folder where you installed Git (C:\\Program Files(x86)\\Git is default I THINK) and copy this url. Go back to the window where you can edit the PATH variable. Add a semicolon at the end of its value (if not already there) and paste the path for Git.\r\n\r\nDo the same for JDK (might be more difficult, you will have to find the installation folder for JDK and go to /bin/ folder. This is the entire path you will want to put in the PATH variable.\r\n\r\nOnce you're done with this, open your command prompt (Windows-key+R, type cmd and ENTER) and test. Write \"git\" and hit ENTER. Write \"javac\" and hit ENTER. If either doesn't work, retrace your steps and see if you can find out your mistake.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
