This is the setup for Git with Android Studio, which will make\r\nlife much easier for all of us. Just follow these __ steps and you should\r\nbe good to go! Unlike the previous tutorial, this one is complete with\r\nscreenshots to guide you. \r\n\r\n## Step 1: Open Android Studio and click on \"Check out from Version Control\"\r\n\r\n![alt\r\ntext](https://github.com/edwinmosong/edwinmosong.github.io/tree/master/images/first.png)\r\n\r\n## Step 2: Write the team repository's URL (shown in screenshot)\r\nAlso, assign a name for the directory. You want this directory to have a\r\nname that reflects your team or the branch you will work on! In my example, I\r\nuse \"ux-selfie\" for the ux branch.\r\n\r\n![alt\r\ntext](https://github.com/edwinmosong/edwinmosong.github.io/tree/master/images/second.png)\r\n\r\n## Step 3: Basically click Yes and Continue in everything that comes.\r\nThat's it, really...\r\n\r\n![alt\r\ntext](https://github.com/edwinmosong/edwinmosong.github.io/tree/master/images/third.png)\r\n\r\n## Step 4: Now, follow this screenshot and click on Branches.\r\n\r\n![alt\r\ntext](https://github.com/edwinmosong/edwinmosong.github.io/tree/master/images/fourth.jpg)\r\n\r\n## Step 5: You should now see the following:\r\n\r\n![alt\r\ntext](https://github.com/edwinmosong/edwinmosong.github.io/tree/master/images/fifth.png)\r\n\r\n## Step 6: Click on your branch and click \"Checkout as new local branch\"\r\n\r\n![alt\r\ntext](https://github.com/edwinmosong/edwinmosong.github.io/tree/master/images/sixth.png)\r\n\r\n## Step 7: You are done setting up your local branch! \r\nNow, let's test by going to VCS->Git->Pull. If your branch is automatically\r\nselected, everything should be fine and you are ready to push and pull to\r\nand from the remote repository (@ your branch!)\r\n\r\n![alt\r\ntext](https://github.com/edwinmosong/edwinmosong.github.io/tree/master/images/seventh.png)\r\n\r\n![alt\r\ntext](https://github.com/edwinmosong/edwinmosong.github.io/tree/master/images/eight.png)\r\n\r\n## Step 8: Lastly, this is how your Android Studio would look\r\nIf you added multiple branches! The steps are the same for all branches. I\r\nwill remind you that you shouldn't touch the 'release' branch! \r\n\r\n![alt\r\ntext](https://github.com/edwinmosong/edwinmosong.github.io/tree/master/images/last.png)\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
