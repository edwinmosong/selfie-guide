##  Team SELFIE

###Tutorial

Hey guys. This is the setup for Git with Android Studio, which will make
life much easier for all of us. Just follow these 8 steps and you should
be good to go! Unlike the previous tutorial, this one is complete with
screenshots to guide you. 

## Step 1: Open Android Studio and click on "Check out from Version Control"

## Step 2: Write the team repository's URL (shown in screenshot)
Also, assign a name for the directory. You want this directory to have a
name that reflects your team or the branch you will work on! In my example, I
use "ux-selfie" for the ux branch.

## Step 7: You are done setting up your local branch! 
Now, let's test by going to VCS->Git->Pull. If your branch is automatically
selected, everything should be fine and you are ready to push and pull to
and from the remote repository (@ your branch!)

## Step 8: Lastly, this is how your Android Studio would look like...
If you added multiple branches! The steps are the same for all branches. I
will remind you that you shouldn't touch the 'release' branch!
